# Zeus

Zeus is a fully customizable Discord bot written in [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## About
Zeus was originally written for a subset of communities I am a part of that wanted a custom bot.
Rather than making one for each community, I decided to create a fully customizable bot so I can maintain one code base but allow customizations between Discord servers (each server has it's own bot user.

This repo's primary focus is for that goal.

**You will receive little support if you try to run this code by yourself.**

That being said, I will still publicly maintain it for educational purposes. You could also run it yourself, but that's up to you, and I would highly prefer some sort of credit if you do.
